        The accent colour, a Catppuccin Mocha name (the Nebelung palette is a
        grey-tinted Mocha). It recolours the tools nebelhaus injects colours
        into — lazygit, fzf, yazi, and the Zen browser — via the matching
        Nebelung per-accent ports.

        Honest scope: this moves the accent on those tools, NOT literally
        everything. Single-file dotfiles that bake the palette at their own
        theme slot (ghostty, starship, tmux, bat, zellij, …) keep their built-in
        colour and don't follow this option. The base palette stays the same
        Nebelung grey either way — only the accent hue changes.

        The desktop wallpaper, set at each home-manager activation (osascript,
        every desktop on the current Space). Four Nebelung looks:

          orbits · constellation · flow  hand-made, the palette baked in
          bold                           generated from theme.accent, so it
                                         follows the accent (a bold pink at
                                         accent = "pink")

        Default "none" leaves your current wallpaper alone — changing the
        desktop is visible and personal, so nothing moves unless you ask (the
        bootstrap interview offers the choice on a fresh install).
